what: >
    A branch is essentially a pointer to the last commit you made. As you go on
    committing, this pointer will automatically update to point the latest
    commit. You use branches to work on more than one features parallelly,
    without one affecting the other.

how:
    create: |
        You can create a new branch from current branch, using `git checkout -b <branch name>`.
        Usually you'd want to branch off of master.
    change: &checkout You can switch branch using `git checkout <branch name>`
    checkout: *checkout
